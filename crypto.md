# Cryptographic Features for Fantasy Football League

## Overview

This document explores cryptographic mechanisms to enhance fairness, security, and competitive integrity in the git-based Fantasy Football League. These features prevent information leakage, ensure commitment authenticity, and create a trustless competitive environment.

## Core Cryptographic Concepts

### 1. Blind Commitment System

#### Problem Statement
In traditional fantasy football, early transfers can influence other players' decisions. Players who submit transfers early may be at a disadvantage if their choices become visible before the deadline.

#### Solution: Commit-Reveal Protocol
Implement a two-phase transfer system using cryptographic commitments:

**Phase 1: Commitment (Before Deadline)**
```bash
# Player creates transfer decision
echo '{"out": "player_123", "in": "player_456"}' > transfer.json

# Generate commitment hash
openssl dgst -sha256 transfer.json > commitment.txt

# Submit only the hash via PR
git add teams/{username}/commitments/gameweek-{n}.txt
git commit -m "chore: Submit transfer commitment for GW{n}"
git push && create PR
```

**Phase 2: Reveal (After Deadline)**
```bash
# After deadline passes, reveal the actual transfer
git add teams/{username}/transfers/gameweek-{n}.json
git commit -m "chore: Reveal transfer for GW{n}"
git push && create PR

# GitHub Actions verify: hash(revealed_transfer) == committed_hash
```

**Verification (One-line Commands)**
```bash
# Method 1: Using openssl to verify commitment matches revealed transfer
[ "$(openssl dgst -sha256 transfer.json | cut -d' ' -f2)" = "$(cat commitment.txt | cut -d' ' -f2)" ] && echo "✅ Valid" || echo "❌ Invalid"

# Method 2: Using sha256sum (more common on Linux)
[ "$(sha256sum transfer.json | cut -d' ' -f1)" = "$(cat commitment.txt)" ] && echo "✅ Valid" || echo "❌ Invalid"

# Method 3: Using shasum (macOS/Unix)
[ "$(shasum -a 256 transfer.json | cut -d' ' -f1)" = "$(cat commitment.txt)" ] && echo "✅ Valid" || echo "❌ Invalid"

# Method 4: Direct diff comparison
diff <(openssl dgst -sha256 transfer.json) commitment.txt && echo "✅ Valid" || echo "❌ Invalid"

# Method 5: In GitHub Actions workflow
echo "::set-output name=valid::$([ \"$(openssl dgst -sha256 transfer.json | cut -d' ' -f2)\" = \"$(cat commitment.txt | cut -d' ' -f2)\" ] && echo true || echo false)"
```

#### Benefits
- No player gains advantage from seeing others' transfers
- Transfers are binding once committed
- Transparent verification process
- Maintains competitive integrity

### 2. Asymmetric Key Encryption for Transfers

#### Implementation Design

**Gameweek Key Generation**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/generate-gameweek-keys.yml
name: Generate Gameweek Keys
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * MON'  # Weekly on Monday

jobs:
  generate:
    steps:
      - name: Generate RSA Key Pair
        run: |
          openssl genrsa -out gw_private.pem 4096
          openssl rsa -in gw_private.pem -pubout -out gw_public.pem
      
      - name: Store Public Key
        run: |
          cp gw_public.pem data/keys/gameweek-${GW}/public.pem
          git add data/keys/gameweek-${GW}/public.pem
          git commit -m "bot: Public key for gameweek ${GW}"
          git push
      
      - name: Secure Private Key
        run: |
          # Store in GitHub Secrets or secure vault
          # Released after deadline
```

**User Transfer Encryption**
```bash
# Encrypt transfer with gameweek public key
openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin \
  -inkey data/keys/gameweek-38/public.pem \
  -in transfer.json \
  -out transfer.enc

# Submit encrypted transfer
git add teams/{username}/transfers/gameweek-38.enc
git commit -m "feat: Encrypted transfer for GW38"
```

**Automated Decryption After Deadline**
```yaml
- name: Decrypt All Transfers
  if: github.event.schedule == '0 0 * * SAT'
  run: |
    for file in teams/*/transfers/gameweek-${GW}.enc; do
      openssl rsautl -decrypt \
        -inkey gw_private.pem \
        -in $file \
        -out ${file%.enc}.json
    done
```

### 3. Digital Signatures for Team Authentication

#### GPG Signing Requirements

**Initial Setup**
```bash
# Generate GPG key for player
gpg --gen-key

# Export public key
gpg --export --armor {email} > teams/{username}/public-key.asc

# Configure git to sign commits
git config --global user.signingkey {KEY_ID}
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

**Verification Workflow**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/verify-signatures.yml
- name: Verify GPG Signature
  run: |
    # Import team owner's public key
    gpg --import teams/${{ github.actor }}/public-key.asc
    
    # Verify commit signature
    git verify-commit HEAD
    
    # Ensure commit author matches team owner
    if [ "$(git log -1 --format='%ae')" != "${{ github.actor }}@users.noreply.github.com" ]; then
      echo "Signature mismatch!"
      exit 1
    fi
```

#### Benefits
- Prevents impersonation
- Non-repudiation of transfers
- Cryptographic proof of team ownership
- Audit trail with verified authorship

### 4. Time-Locked Smart Commitments

#### Concept
Use cryptographic time-lock puzzles or hash chains to create transfers that can only be revealed after specific conditions are met.

**Time-Lock Puzzle Implementation**
```python
import hashlib
import time

class TimeLockPuzzle:
    def __init__(self, secret, iterations=1000000):
        self.iterations = iterations
        self.puzzle = self.create_puzzle(secret)
    
    def create_puzzle(self, secret):
        """Create a computationally intensive puzzle"""
        result = secret.encode()
        for _ in range(self.iterations):
            result = hashlib.sha256(result).digest()
        return result.hex()
    
    def verify_solution(self, proposed_secret):
        """Verify the solution matches the puzzle"""
        return self.create_puzzle(proposed_secret) == self.puzzle

# Player creates time-locked transfer
puzzle = TimeLockPuzzle(
    secret="transfer:out=player_123,in=player_456",
    iterations=10000000  # ~10 seconds to solve
)

# Commit the puzzle
commit_data = {
    "puzzle": puzzle.puzzle,
    "iterations": puzzle.iterations,
    "deadline": "2024-09-01T11:00:00Z"
}
```

### 5. Zero-Knowledge Proofs for League Verification

#### Use Cases

**Budget Compliance Proof**
Prove your team is within budget without revealing exact player prices paid:

```python
from zksnark import ZKProof

class BudgetProof:
    def __init__(self, team_cost, max_budget=100.0):
        self.proof = self.generate_proof(team_cost, max_budget)
    
    def generate_proof(self, cost, max_budget):
        """Generate ZK proof that cost <= max_budget"""
        # Simplified representation
        return {
            "commitment": hash(cost),
            "proof": "zk_proof_data",
            "public_input": max_budget
        }
    
    def verify(self, proof, max_budget):
        """Verify the proof without knowing actual cost"""
        # Verification logic
        return True  # if valid
```

**Chip Usage Verification**
Prove you haven't used a chip without revealing your full chip history:

```yaml
chips_used:
  wildcard1: <commitment_hash>
  wildcard2: <commitment_hash>
  proof: <zk_proof_of_unused_chips>
```

### 6. Merkle Trees for Efficient League Verification

#### Implementation

```python
import hashlib

class MerkleTree:
    def __init__(self, teams):
        self.teams = teams
        self.tree = self.build_tree(teams)
        self.root = self.tree[-1][0]
    
    def build_tree(self, leaves):
        """Build Merkle tree from team data"""
        tree = [leaves]
        while len(tree[-1]) > 1:
            layer = []
            for i in range(0, len(tree[-1]), 2):
                if i + 1 < len(tree[-1]):
                    combined = tree[-1][i] + tree[-1][i + 1]
                else:
                    combined = tree[-1][i] + tree[-1][i]
                layer.append(hashlib.sha256(combined.encode()).hexdigest())
            tree.append(layer)
        return tree
    
    def get_proof(self, team_index):
        """Generate Merkle proof for specific team"""
        proof = []
        for layer in self.tree[:-1]:
            if team_index % 2 == 0 and team_index + 1 < len(layer):
                proof.append(layer[team_index + 1])
            elif team_index % 2 == 1:
                proof.append(layer[team_index - 1])
            team_index //= 2
        return proof
```

**Use in League Standings**
```json
{
  "gameweek": 10,
  "merkle_root": "3f4d5e6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a",
  "total_teams": 1000,
  "standings": "ipfs://QmXxx..."  // Large standings file
}
```

### 7. Homomorphic Encryption for Private Leagues

#### Concept
Calculate league standings without decrypting individual team scores:

```python
from phe import paillier

# League admin generates keys
public_key, private_key = paillier.generate_paillier_keypair()

# Each team encrypts their score
team1_score = public_key.encrypt(75)
team2_score = public_key.encrypt(82)
team3_score = public_key.encrypt(69)

# Calculate total and average without decryption
encrypted_total = team1_score + team2_score + team3_score
encrypted_average = encrypted_total / 3

# Only league admin can decrypt final results
total = private_key.decrypt(encrypted_total)  # 226
average = private_key.decrypt(encrypted_average)  # 75.33
```

## Implementation Roadmap

## Security Considerations

### Key Management
```yaml
key_storage:
  private_keys:
    location: GitHub Secrets / HSM
    rotation: Per gameweek
    backup: Encrypted cold storage
  
  public_keys:
    location: Repository (data/keys/)
    format: PEM
    verification: SHA-256 checksum
```

### Attack Vectors & Mitigations

| Attack | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Early reveal of transfers | Commit-reveal protocol with penalties |
| Key compromise | Key rotation per gameweek |
| Replay attacks | Nonce/timestamp in commitments |
| Collusion | Zero-knowledge proofs |
| Data tampering | Merkle tree verification |

## Example Workflows

### Secure Transfer Submission

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# secure-transfer.sh

GAMEWEEK=$1
TRANSFER_JSON=$2

# 1. Create commitment
COMMITMENT=$(sha256sum $TRANSFER_JSON | cut -d' ' -f1)

# 2. Encrypt transfer
openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin \
  -inkey data/keys/gw-$GAMEWEEK/public.pem \
  -in $TRANSFER_JSON \
  -out transfer.enc

# 3. Sign the commitment
echo $COMMITMENT | gpg --sign --armor > commitment.sig

# 4. Submit via PR
git add teams/$(whoami)/commitments/gw-$GAMEWEEK/
git commit -S -m "feat: Secure transfer for GW$GAMEWEEK"
git push
```

### League Verification

```python
# verify_league.py
import json
from merkle import MerkleTree

def verify_league_integrity(gameweek):
    # Load all team scores
    teams = load_team_scores(gameweek)
    
    # Build Merkle tree
    tree = MerkleTree(teams)
    
    # Compare with published root
    published_root = load_published_root(gameweek)
    
    if tree.root == published_root:
        print("✅ League integrity verified")
        return True
    else:
        print("❌ League integrity check failed")
        return False
```
