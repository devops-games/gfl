Following the success model of the git-based Fantasy Football League, here are other games that would thrive using git workflows, pull requests, and CI/CD as game mechanics.

## Evaluation Criteria
Games work best with this approach when they have:
- ✅ Turn-based or asynchronous gameplay
- ✅ State changes that can be validated
- ✅ Benefits from transparency/audit trails
- ✅ Educational value for developers
- ✅ Can be represented as text/data files
- ✅ Community/multiplayer aspects

## 🌟 Conclusion

The git-based gaming approach works best for:
1. **Turn-based strategy games** (Chess, Go, Diplomacy)
2. **Management simulations** (Trading, Fantasy Sports, City Building)
3. **Collaborative games** (Story Writing, D&D, World Building)
4. **Educational games** (Code Golf, DevOps Simulations)
5. **Tournament structures** (Poker, TCGs, Competitions)

The key is choosing games where:
- Version control adds value (history, branching, rollback)
- Transparency improves gameplay (audit trails, fairness)
- Validation is important (rule enforcement, cheat prevention)
- Community interaction enhances experience (reviews, discussions)
- Educational value exists (learning git/DevOps while playing)

This could literally spawn a new genre: **"Version Control Games"** or **"DevOps Entertainment"**!
