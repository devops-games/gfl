# Git Football League as a Kubernetes Operator

## ü§î The Concept

What if fantasy football wasn't just git-native, but cloud-native? This document explores how GFL could be implemented as a Kubernetes operator, where teams, transfers, and leagues become Kubernetes resources managed through `kubectl`.

## üìê Architecture Vision

### Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

Instead of JSON files in git, we'd define fantasy football concepts as Kubernetes resources:

```yaml
# Team CRD
apiVersion: gfl.io/v1
kind: Team
metadata:
  name: code-warriors-fc
  namespace: premier-league
spec:
  manager: martinpalastanga
  budget: 100.0
  formation: "4-4-2"
  squad:
    goalkeepers: 
      - playerId: alisson-123
      - playerId: ramsdale-456
    defenders:
      - playerId: taa-789
      # ... more players
  captain: haaland-999
  viceCaptain: salah-888
status:
  totalPoints: 523
  gameweekPoints: 67
  rank: 1247
  value: 99.8
```

```yaml
# Transfer CRD
apiVersion: gfl.io/v1
kind: Transfer
metadata:
  name: gw12-transfer-1
  namespace: premier-league
spec:
  team: code-warriors-fc
  gameweek: 12
  playerOut: sterling-333
  playerIn: saka-444
  transferType: free
status:
  validated: true
  pointsCost: 0
  budgetImpact: -1.5
```

```yaml
# League CRD
apiVersion: gfl.io/v1
kind: League
metadata:
  name: devops-champions
  namespace: gfl-system
spec:
  type: classic
  maxTeams: 20
  joinCode: ABC123
  creator: admin
status:
  teams: 12
  gameweek: 11
  leader: code-warriors-fc
```

## üéÆ Gameplay Through kubectl

### Creating Your Team
```bash
# Apply team configuration
kubectl apply -f my-team.yaml

# Or create imperatively
kubectl create team code-warriors-fc \
  --manager=martinpalastanga \
  --budget=100.0 \
  --formation=4-4-2
```

### Making Transfers
```bash
# Create a transfer
kubectl create transfer gw12-transfer \
  --team=code-warriors-fc \
  --player-out=sterling \
  --player-in=saka

# View pending transfers
kubectl get transfers --pending

# Check transfer validation
kubectl describe transfer gw12-transfer
```

### Managing Your Squad
```bash
# View your team
kubectl get team code-warriors-fc -o wide

# Set captain
kubectl patch team code-warriors-fc \
  --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/captain", "value": "haaland-999"}]'

# Use a chip
kubectl annotate team code-warriors-fc \
  chip=wildcard \
  gameweek=12
```

### League Operations
```bash
# View league standings
kubectl get league premier-league -o custom-columns=\
  TEAM:.status.standings[*].team,\
  POINTS:.status.standings[*].points

# Join a league
kubectl patch team code-warriors-fc \
  --type='merge' \
  -p='{"spec":{"leagues":["devops-champions"]}}'

# Create a private league
kubectl create league my-private-league \
  --type=h2h \
  --max-teams=10
```

## ü§ñ The Operator Pattern

### Controller Responsibilities

The GFL operator would run controllers that:

1. **Team Controller**
   - Validates squad composition (15 players, within budget)
   - Enforces max 3 players per club rule
   - Calculates team value
   - Updates team status after each gameweek

2. **Transfer Controller**
   - Validates transfers against deadlines
   - Checks budget constraints
   - Applies point deductions for extra transfers
   - Updates team roster when approved

3. **Gameweek Controller**
   - Processes match results
   - Calculates points for all teams
   - Triggers auto-substitutions
   - Updates league standings

4. **Validation Webhook**
   - Intercepts team/transfer creates and updates
   - Ensures all FPL rules are followed
   - Prevents invalid states

### Event-Driven Architecture

```yaml
# Events generated by the operator
Events:
  Type    Reason           Age   From           Message
  ----    ------           ----  ----           -------
  Normal  TransferCreated  5m    gfl-operator   Transfer request created: Sterling -> Saka
  Normal  ValidationPassed 5m    gfl-operator   Transfer validated successfully
  Normal  TeamUpdated      4m    gfl-operator   Team roster updated
  Normal  PointsCalculated 1m    gfl-operator   Gameweek 12 points: 67
```

## üîÑ GitOps Integration

While primarily kubectl-driven, we could maintain GitOps compatibility:

```yaml
# teams/martinpalastanga/team.yaml in git
apiVersion: gfl.io/v1
kind: Team
metadata:
  name: code-warriors-fc
  namespace: premier-league
spec:
  # ... team specification
```

With Flux or ArgoCD:
```bash
# Automatic sync from git to cluster
git add teams/martinpalastanga/team.yaml
git commit -m "transfers: GW12 - Saka in for Sterling"
git push
# ArgoCD/Flux applies changes to cluster
```

## üéØ Advantages of Kubernetes Approach

### Native Features We Get for Free

1. **RBAC** - Fine-grained permissions
   ```yaml
   # Only allow managers to edit their own teams
   kind: Role
   apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
   metadata:
     name: team-manager
   rules:
   - apiGroups: ["gfl.io"]
     resources: ["teams"]
     verbs: ["get", "patch"]
     resourceNames: ["code-warriors-fc"]
   ```

2. **Audit Logging** - Every action tracked
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n kube-system kube-apiserver | grep gfl.io
   ```

3. **Resource Quotas** - Limit transfers per gameweek
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ResourceQuota
   metadata:
     name: transfer-quota
   spec:
     hard:
       transfers.gfl.io: "20"  # Max 20 transfers per gameweek
   ```

4. **Namespaces** - Natural league separation
   ```bash
   kubectl create namespace premier-league
   kubectl create namespace championship
   ```

5. **Webhooks** - Validation and mutation
   ```yaml
   # Automatic deadline enforcement
   apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
   kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
   metadata:
     name: transfer-deadline
   webhooks:
   - name: deadline.gfl.io
     rules:
     - apiGroups: ["gfl.io"]
       resources: ["transfers"]
       operations: ["CREATE", "UPDATE"]
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Considerations

### State Management
- **etcd** becomes our database (instead of git)
- Built-in consistency and high availability
- Watch API for real-time updates

### Scaling
- Horizontal pod autoscaling for operator pods
- Could handle thousands of teams across multiple clusters
- Federation for global leagues

### Observability
```bash
# Prometheus metrics exposed by operator
gfl_team_total_points{team="code-warriors-fc"} 523
gfl_transfers_remaining{team="code-warriors-fc"} 2
gfl_gameweek_current 12
gfl_deadline_seconds_remaining 86400

# Grafana dashboards for league visualization
```

## üéÆ Advanced Features

### Custom Schedulers
```go
// Custom scheduler for optimal captain selection
type CaptainScheduler struct {
    client kubernetes.Interface
}

func (cs *CaptainScheduler) Schedule(team *Team) *Player {
    // Algorithm to suggest best captain based on:
    // - Form
    // - Fixtures
    // - Historical performance
}
```

### Service Mesh Integration
```yaml
# Istio traffic management for A/B testing features
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: gfl-operator
spec:
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        beta-tester:
          exact: "true"
    route:
    - destination:
        host: gfl-operator-beta
```

### Helm Charts for Team Templates
```bash
# Deploy a balanced team template
helm install my-team gfl/team-templates/balanced \
  --set manager=martinpalastanga \
  --set teamName="Code Warriors FC"

# Templates available:
# - gfl/team-templates/balanced
# - gfl/team-templates/attacking
# - gfl/team-templates/defensive
# - gfl/team-templates/budget
```

## ü§ù Multi-Cluster Leagues

```bash
# Federated leagues across clusters
kubectl --context=eu-west-1 create team my-team
kubectl --context=us-east-1 get league global-league

# Submarine for cross-cluster networking
# Teams can compete globally
```

## üöÄ CLI Plugin

```bash
# Install kubectl plugin
kubectl krew install gfl

# Enhanced commands
kubectl gfl status              # Pretty-printed team status
kubectl gfl transfer --wizard    # Interactive transfer wizard
kubectl gfl simulate gw12        # Simulate gameweek points
kubectl gfl captain suggest      # AI-powered captain suggestions
```

## üìä CRD Status Subresources

```yaml
# Rich status information
apiVersion: gfl.io/v1
kind: Team
status:
  conditions:
  - type: Ready
    status: "True"
    lastTransitionTime: "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  - type: BudgetValid
    status: "True"
    message: "Team within budget: ¬£99.8m/¬£100.0m"
  - type: SquadComplete
    status: "True"
    message: "15/15 players selected"
  gameweekHistory:
  - gameweek: 11
    points: 67
    rank: 1247
    transfers: 1
  - gameweek: 10
    points: 52
    rank: 1589
    transfers: 2
```

## üîÆ Future Possibilities

kind: ChampionsLeague
spec:
  qualificationCriteria:
    - topTeamsPerLeague: 4
  format: knockout
  startGameweek: 20
```

```

## ü§î Philosophical Questions

1. **Is this over-engineering?** Perhaps, but it's beautifully over-engineered.

2. **Why Kubernetes?** Because if you can run it in Kubernetes, you should run it in Kubernetes.

3. **Would anyone use this?** The intersection of DevOps engineers and fantasy football fans is larger than you think.

4. **Is it web-scale?** With Kubernetes, everything is web-scale.

## üéØ Conclusion

While the git-based approach teaches version control and PR workflows, a Kubernetes operator approach would teach:
- Cloud-native patterns
- Declarative resource management
- Controller reconciliation loops
- Kubernetes API extensions
- Modern DevOps practices

It's fantasy football as a platform engineering exercise - because why just play a game when you can architect a distributed system around it?
